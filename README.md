# ChessGO

Chess implementation in the Go Programming Language using the [ebiten](https://ebiten.org/) library.

## Game shortcomings 

- There's no check alert
- Game ends when the king is captured
- You cannot castle so don't hold yourself back from moving the king when you need to
- Local Multiplayer (isn't online)
