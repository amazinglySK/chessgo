# ChessGO

Chess implementation in the Go Programming Language using the ebiten library.

## Game features (mostly excuses :sweat_smile:)

- There's no check alert
- The winner still isn't declared (in future winer would be declared when you capture the king)
- Local Multiplayer (isn't online)

*:stopwatch: Sorry I didn't have much time for this project...*
